# hello-world
This is my start to a new career!
Hello!

I have been coding since January and I have been focusing on web development, so I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right now. I am looking to expand my skills to find a satisfying career in programming that also utilizes my background in Biology, Personal Finance, and maybe even Philosophy. I love learning new things and coding is turning out to be a lot of fun.
